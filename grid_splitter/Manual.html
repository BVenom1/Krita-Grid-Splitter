<h1>BVenom's Grid Splitter : a tool to help digital artists split and save their work easily</h1>
<p>
    Have you ever visited your favourite artist's Ig page, and noticed 
    an artwork that spans multiple slides, and connects seemlessly?
</p>
<p>
    Or maybe you've read a webtoon that has loooong connected vertical 
    spreads, even though the maximum dimensions for a webtoon page are 
    800 x 1280.
</p>
<p>
    How are they doing this? Surely they're not drawing the diferent 
    slides separately, are they?
</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>N. O.</p>
<p>
    They're using a splitter tool to split the large drawing into smaller 
    pieces. And now, you can too, right from Krita!!!
</p>
<p>
    The Grid Splitter enables you to split the active layer into sections 
    based on dimensions provided by the user. it gets full splits (splits 
    that are the provided dimensions) starting from the top-left corner. 
    it does save the fractional sections too, if they exist.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    set the width and height of sections ('split width' and 'split height'), 
    choose the file type to save to, and then click 'split'. it will open a 
    menu to select the folder where you want to save the splits. select the 
    folder, sit back and let the splitter do it's thing for a few seconds.
</p>
<p>
    And that's it. it's that simple. you now have sections of your very own 
    large, sprawling artwork. You're welcome.
</p>
