<h1>BVenom's Grid Splitter : a tool to help digital artists split and save their work easily</h1>
<p>
    Have you ever when to your favourite artist's Ig page, 
    and noticed an artwork that spans multiple slides, 
    and connects seemlessly?
</p>
<p>
    Or maybe you've read a webtoon that has a loooong 
    connected vertical spread, even though the maximum 
    dimensions for a webtoon page are 800 x 1280.
</p>
<p>
    How are they doing this? Surely they're not drawing 
    the diferent slides separately, are they?
</p>
<p>
    No. N. O. They're using a splitter tool to split the 
    large drawing into smaller pieces. And now, you can too, 
    right from Krita!!!
</p>
<p>
    The Grid Splitter enables you to split the active layer into 
    sections based on the dimensions provided by the user 
    for the 'split width' and 'split height' fields. it starts 
    on the top-left corner and gets as many full splits as 
    possible. it does save the fractional sections too, if they 
    exist.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    set the width and height of the sections ('split width' and 
    'split height'), choose the file type to save to, and then click 
    'split'. it will open a folder selection menu, to select the 
    folder where you want to save the splits. select the folder, 
    and sit back and let the splitter do it's thing for a few seconds
</p>
<p>
    And that's it. it's that simple. you now have sections of your very 
    own large, sprawling artwork. You're welcome
</p>
<p>
    Your's Truly
